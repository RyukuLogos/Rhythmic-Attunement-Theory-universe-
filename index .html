            <h2 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 0; border: none; padding: 0;">The First Principle of the Universe: All Waves Seek to Close</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 500;">All wave phenomena (vibrations, number-theoretic rhythms, phase patterns) existing in the universe have a tendency to take <strong>closed structures</strong> (phase matching, periodic alignment) as much as possible. By closing, they achieve stability, energy minimization, and harmony.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-number">0.</span> Cosmogony: From Chaos to Structure</h2>
        
        <h3>0.1 From Chaos to Being: Formation of Primary Rings through Resonance</h3>
        <p>Before the birth of the universe, there existed only chaotic waves. There were all kinds of waves—both periodic and random. This was essentially <span class="highlight">equivalent to nothingness</span>, and from this, only resonating waves naturally formed primary rings. Rational waves eventually achieve phase alignment. These are closed structures. Therefore, according to the first principle, rational waves first form primary rings.</p>
        
        <h3>0.2 Big Bang and the Birth of Space: Dispersion of Irrational Numbers</h3>
        <p>The formed rational rings are stable waves, while irrational waves that can never close accumulate frustration. This frustration creates the Big Bang and space. <span class="highlight">To release frustration, irrational waves repel each other and disperse in spatial directions</span>. This is the true nature of space and the source of the universe that continues to expand at a metric expansion that can exceed c at large scales (without violating local special relativity).</p>
        
        <h3>0.3 Birth of Electrons, Quarks, Mass and Gravity: irrational-phase components that can approach closure</h3>
        <p>Among the irrational numbers dispersed in spatial directions, some can approach closure by capturing other waves. These are irrational numbers that can exist stably. These become elementary particles such as electrons and quarks. And <strong>the void left by other waves captured for closure becomes gravity</strong>, and this deviation is proportional to the mass of elementary particles.</p>
        
        <p>The kinetic term <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏ<span class="superscript">2</span></span><span class="denominator">2m</span></span> in the Schrödinger equation represents this "difficulty of phase correction." It is the energy cost to maintain irrational phases as rational, and the larger the mass, the more energy is required for correction. By continuously absorbing this energy from surrounding waves, the constant effect called gravity is born.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
        <p>This research proposes a new theory that reinterprets the origins of mass, gravity, speed of light, and spatial structure based on wave-like phase structures and "rationalization processes." In the conventional Standard Model, particle masses are said to arise from interactions with the Higgs field, and gravity is described as spacetime curvature according to general relativity. However, this theory attempts to explain these phenomena uniformly as <span class="highlight">"energy of phase deviation correction in tension media."</span></p>
        
        <p>The theory's starting point lies in the following assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Waves in space originally have irrational phase differences (non-closing periods).</li>
            <li>Rational phase differences close completely, forming light and stable structures (massless particles).</li>
            <li>Irrational phase differences are corrected by other waves. The energy required for this correction appears as mass and gravity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This allows mass to be interpreted not as "a byproduct of stabilized closed structures" but as "a measured value of tension energy that exists to correct phase deviations." This tension depends on the medium's stiffness (phase correction capability), resulting in a proportional relationship between mass and gravitational strength.</p>
        
        <p>This research presents the following major achievements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Equation derivation</strong> — Reinterpret the Schrödinger equation from the perspective of tension energy and derive the relationship between mass and internal phase deviation (Θ).</li>
            <li><strong>Theoretical derivation of speed of light and Planck length</strong> — Derive the speed of light from the velocity limit of rationalization chains and the Planck length from the reference length for phase closure, showing consistency with known physical constants.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation of pure leptonic decay</strong> — Explain the decay lifetimes of muons and tau particles from phase structures and examine consistency with measured values.</li>
            <li><strong>Direction for experimental verification</strong> — Present methodologies for theoretical verification using neutrino oscillation, particle mass differences, and lifetime data.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>This paper first introduces the theoretical background and mathematical model, then uses it to explain specific phenomena such as the speed of light, Planck length, and particle decay. Subsequently, it discusses comparison with existing data and possibilities for experimental verification, and finally summarizes the significance and challenges of the theory.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">2.</span> Theoretical Background</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Concept of Phase and "Closure"</h3>
        <p>Phase in physical systems is a parameter representing the progress of waves or states of vibration, determining the relative positional relationships of periodic motion. In this theory, cases where phase differences are expressed as rational ratios are called "closure," defined as stable periodic motion where the structure completely returns to its original state even after infinite time.</p>
        
        <p>Conversely, when phase differences are irrational ratios, the motion never completely returns to its original state, accumulating deviations spatially and temporally. To correct these deviations, interference with other waves is necessary, and this correction process generates energetic tension in the system.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Irrational Phase Deviations and the Origin of Mass</h3>
        <p>In this theory, mass is interpreted as follows:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            E = ℏω<span class="subscript">corr</span>
        </div>
        <p>Where ω<span class="subscript">corr</span> is the correction frequency for approximating phase deviations to rational numbers, and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant.</p>
        
        <p>The correction frequency is proportional to the magnitude of deviation Δφ<span class="subscript">int</span>. To measure deviations, we introduce a "rational approximation distance" that evaluates the approximation accuracy of irrational components relative to the wave's intrinsic period T₀.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Reinterpretation of the Schrödinger Equation</h3>
        <p>The non-relativistic Schrödinger equation is given as:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            iℏ <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">∂ψ</span><span class="denominator">∂t</span></span> = -<span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏ<span class="superscript">2</span></span><span class="denominator">2m</span></span> ∇<span class="superscript">2</span>ψ + Vψ
        </div>
        <p>In this theory, the kinetic term <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏ<span class="superscript">2</span></span><span class="denominator">2m</span></span> in this equation is interpreted as the inverse of "ease of phase correction in tension media (softness)."</p>
        
        <p>That is, mass m is proportional to "the amount of energy required to correct phases," and if phase deviation is zero (perfect closure), then m = 0. This explains the existence of massless particles like photons and gluons as rational phase structures.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Relationship Between Internal Phase Deviation Θ<span class="subscript">int</span> and Mass</h3>
        <p>In actual physical systems, we assume that particle mass has the following proportional relationship with internal phase deviation Θ<span class="subscript">int</span>:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            Θ<span class="subscript">int</span> = k<span class="sqrt">m</span>
        </div>
        <p>Where k is a characteristic constant of the rationalization medium, representing the phase coupling capability of space. This relationship can be determined by comparison with neutrino oscillations, lepton decay lifetimes, and Planck scale phenomena.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">3.</span> Equation Derivation</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Derivation of Correction Frequency from Irrational Phase Deviations</h3>
        <p>When phase deviation Δφ<span class="subscript">int</span> is irrational, the wave generates correction oscillations to align the deviation to the nearest rational ratio. The frequency ω<span class="subscript">corr</span> of this correction oscillation can be expressed as:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            ω<span class="subscript">corr</span> = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">Δφ<span class="subscript">int</span></span><span class="denominator">T₀</span></span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Where T₀ is the intrinsic period, λ is the wavelength, and v is the phase velocity (corresponding to the speed of light or matter wave velocity).</p>
        
        <p>The correction energy is E<span class="subscript">corr</span> = ℏω<span class="subscript">corr</span>, and we assume this corresponds to the particle's rest energy E₀.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Relationship Between Mass and Phase Deviation</h3>
        <p>Comparing the above equation with E₀ = mc², we get mc² = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏΔφ<span class="subscript">int</span></span><span class="denominator">T₀</span></span>. Substituting the de Broglie relation T₀ = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">h</span><span class="denominator">mc²</span></span> for matter waves:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            mc² = ℏΔφ<span class="subscript">int</span> · <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">mc²</span><span class="denominator">h</span></span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Using h = 2πℏ, we get Δφ<span class="subscript">int</span> = 2π.</p>
        
        <p>However, this is the condition for perfect closure, and in reality, we consider that Δφ<span class="subscript">int</span> has a small deviation δ from 2π: Δφ<span class="subscript">int</span> = 2π + δ</p>
        
        <p>This deviation δ has irrational properties, and the relationship δ ∝ <span class="sqrt">m</span> is derived.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Derivation of the Speed of Light</h3>
        <p>Correction propagation proceeds by sequentially rationalizing irrational phases scattered in space. The progression speed of this "closure chain" determines the upper limit of the speed of light c.</p>
        
        <p>Let τ<span class="subscript">min</span> be the minimum step time for phase correction and l<span class="subscript">min</span> be the minimum distance, then:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            c = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">l<span class="subscript">min</span></span><span class="denominator">τ<span class="subscript">min</span></span></span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Assuming l<span class="subscript">min</span> is the Planck length and τ<span class="subscript">min</span> is the Planck time, the known speed of light value is reproduced:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            c = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator"><span class="sqrt"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏG</span><span class="denominator">c³</span></span></span></span><span class="denominator"><span class="sqrt"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏG</span><span class="denominator">c⁵</span></span></span></span></span> = c
        </div>
        
        <p>That is, the speed of light naturally appears as "the ratio of the minimum spatial unit and minimum time unit for phase closure."</p>

        <h3>3.4 Derivation of Planck Length</h3>
        <p>Conversely, when the speed of light c, gravitational constant G, and ℏ are known, the minimum closure distance (Planck length) is determined by the following equation:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            l<span class="subscript">P</span> = <span class="sqrt"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏG</span><span class="denominator">c³</span></span></span>
        </div>
        
        <p>This value is 1.616 × 10<span class="superscript">-35</span> m and can be interpreted as the distance unit that most easily synchronizes with rational phases.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">4.</span> Speed of Light and Planck Length: Numerical Evaluation and Agreement</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Numerical Values from Definitions</h3>
        <p>From known constants (2022–2024 CODATA):</p>
        <div class="math">
            ℏ = 1.054571817 × 10<span class="superscript">-34</span> J·s<br>
            G = 6.67430 × 10<span class="superscript">-11</span> m³·kg<span class="superscript">-1</span>·s<span class="superscript">-2</span><br>
            c = 299,792,458 m/s
        </div>
        
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            ℓ<span class="subscript">P</span> = <span class="sqrt"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏG</span><span class="denominator">c³</span></span></span> ≈ 1.616255 × 10<span class="superscript">-35</span> m<br>
            t<span class="subscript">P</span> = <span class="sqrt"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏG</span><span class="denominator">c⁵</span></span></span> ≈ 5.391247 × 10<span class="superscript">-44</span> s
        </div>
        
        <p>These match exactly numerically (by definition). In this theory, this ratio is interpreted as <span class="highlight">"one cell/one tick of perfect closure."</span></p>

        <h3>4.2 Re-derivation from Critical Closure (Self-gravity)</h3>
        <p>From the critical conditions r<span class="subscript">s</span> = βL, E ≃ <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏ</span><span class="denominator">T</span></span>, r<span class="subscript">s</span> = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2GE</span><span class="denominator">c⁴</span></span>, we get L = 2β<span class="superscript">-1</span><span class="sqrt"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏG</span><span class="denominator">c³</span></span></span>. Taking β = 2 (two-cell threshold) gives L = ℓ<span class="subscript">P</span>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The "cell length" where phases are most easily aligned is the Planck length, and the speed limit for perfect closure is determined by c = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">L</span><span class="denominator">T</span></span>.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">5.</span> Data Support: Pure Leptonic Decay</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Scaling Hypothesis Mapping</h3>
        <p>Internal phase deviation θ is proportional to the square root of mass: θ ∝ <span class="sqrt">m</span></p>
        <p>If decay width is Γ ∝ θ<span class="superscript">β</span>, then Γ ∝ m<span class="superscript">β/2</span></p>
        <p>Pure leptonic 3-body decay of muons/taus in the Standard Model is known to follow Γ ∝ m⁵, so if this hypothesis is correct, we should get β ≈ 10, which is the aim of this test.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> β ≃ 10 agrees within error. That is, θ ∝ <span class="sqrt">m</span> + Γ ∝ θ⁵, β ≃ 10 ⇒ Γ ∝ m⁵ is supported by data.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Why It Works (Physical Picture)</h3>
        <p>θ is the magnitude of "deviation from perfect closure (light branch)."</p>
        <p>Heavier particles have larger deviations (θ ∝ <span class="sqrt">m</span>) → deviation resolution (decay) occurs more easily, increasing Γ.</p>
        <p>In pure leptonic channels, phase space is simple, so the exponent returns to the ideal value of 5.</p>
        <p>The total width (including tau's hadronic channels) deviates slightly, but this can be understood as standard hadronic corrections (compatibility needs separate examination).</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">6.</span> Derivation of "Deviation Energy" in the Schrödinger Equation</h2>
        
        <h3>6.1 Basic Equation and Solution Phase</h3>
        <p>One-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation:</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>For the plane wave solution ψ(x,t) = Ae<span class="superscript">i(kx-ωt)</span>:</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>The time evolution of phase φ = kx - ωt is <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">dφ</span><span class="denominator">dt</span></span> = k(<span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">dx</span><span class="denominator">dt</span></span>) - ω = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">pv</span><span class="denominator">ℏ</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">E</span><span class="denominator">ℏ</span></span></p>

        <h3>6.2 Phase Comparison with "Perfect Closure"</h3>
        <p>In an ideal "perfect closure" state, phase progression returns to its original state with rational ratios:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            φ(t + T) - φ(t) = 2π <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">p</span><span class="denominator">q</span></span>, p, q ∈ Z
        </div>
        
        <p>Real particles have <strong>irrational phase deviations δθ</strong>, so they don't close completely and accumulate deviations over time.</p>
        <p>Deviation rate: δθ = ω<span class="subscript">obs</span> - ω<span class="subscript">close</span></p>

        <h3>6.3 Definition of Deviation Energy</h3>
        <p>Corresponding energy difference: E<span class="subscript">slip</span> = ℏδθ</p>
        <p>This exists independently of potential energy or kinetic energy and can be interpreted as additional energy required for closure.</p>

        <h3>6.4 Relationship with Mass</h3>
        <p>Assumption: If δθ ∝ <span class="sqrt">m</span>, then E<span class="subscript">slip</span> ∝ ℏ<span class="sqrt">m</span></p>
        <p>This becomes the first-order term of mass origin, providing a mechanism different from the Standard Model's "Higgs mass generation."</p>

        <h3>6.5 Connection with Speed of Light and Planck Length</h3>
        <p>Perfect closure condition: rotating cell length L₀ in tick time T₀ → speed limit c = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">L₀</span><span class="denominator">T₀</span></span></p>
        <p>From critical self-gravity conditions, L₀ = ℓ<span class="subscript">P</span> and T₀ = t<span class="subscript">P</span> are derived, and this ratio matches the known value of c.</p>

        <p><strong>Falsification condition:</strong> Future high precision measurements showing n systematically deviating from 5, breaking the consistency of θ ∝ <span class="sqrt">m</span>.</p>

        <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> θ<span class="subscript">int</span> is the same value near zero regardless of device (upper limit is minimal).</p>
        <p><strong>Falsification condition:</strong> Intercepts show mutually contradictory non-zero values across devices.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">9.</span> Relationship with Existing Theories</h2>
        
        <h3>9.1 Standard Model (Higgs Mechanism)</h3>
        <p>In this theory, "mass" is a measured value of deviation correction energy. The Higgs can be reinterpreted as an "effective description of tension fields."</p>
        <p>Numerically, <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">θₑ</span><span class="denominator"><span class="sqrt">mₑ</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">θ_H</span><span class="denominator"><span class="sqrt">m_H</span></span></span> (linearity) holds (log-log slope <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span>). However, dynamics such as coupling constants and generation amplitudes need to follow the Standard Model (compatibility needs separate examination).</p>

        <h3>9.2 General Relativity (Geometry of Gravity)</h3>
        <p>Einstein's field equation G<span class="subscript">μν</span> = <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">8πG</span><span class="denominator">c⁴</span></span>T<span class="subscript">μν</span> can be interpreted in this theory as an effective law expressing that "local phase density imbalances are reflected in spacetime structure."</p>
        <p>The tensor structure can use existing calculation systems as is, and predictions for observables (Mercury's perihelion precession, gravitational waves, etc.) are identical to general relativity. The difference is only in microscopic interpretation.</p>

        <h3>9.3 Quantum Field Theory (Feynman Diagrams)</h3>
        <p>Scattering amplitude and interaction calculations have the same mathematical structure as standard Feynman diagrams. However, the "interpretation of virtual particles" changes: from conventional "particle propagation in spacetime" to "propagation and resonance of phase corrections."</p>
        <p>Conditions for renormalizability and symmetries (gauge invariance, etc.) are similarly required in phase structures, and the mathematical framework of existing field theory is preserved.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">10.</span> Discussion and Prospects</h2>
        
        <h3>10.1 Significance of the Theory</h3>
        <p>The greatest significance of this theory is presenting a framework that explains the fundamental physical constant groups of mass, gravity, speed of light, and Planck scale from a unified "phase structure theory." The perspective that these quantities, previously treated independently, derive from the single concept of <span class="highlight">"wave closure and irrational deviations"</span> has the potential to bring new understanding to the foundations of physics.</p>

        <h3>10.2 Possibilities for Experimental Verification</h3>
        <p>The following experimental verifications are possible as theoretical predictions:</p>

            <li><strong>Phase analysis of neutron interference experiments</strong>: Verify the existence of "intrinsic phase deviation" component θ<span class="subscript">int</span> other than gravity in precision measurements of COW effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Indirect observation of Planck-scale physics</strong>: Verify the validity of minimum closure length ℓ<span class="subscript">P</span> from light dispersion relations in high-energy cosmic rays and gamma-ray bursts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>10.3 Theoretical Challenges</h3>
        <p>On the other hand, several theoretical challenges remain in this theory:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Establishing quantization methods</strong>: Rigorous mathematical framework needed for quantum mechanical treatment of phase deviations.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency with strong interactions</strong>: Clarifying the relationship between color confinement and asymptotic freedom in QCD and phase closure theory.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmological consequences</strong>: How dark matter and dark energy are described in phase structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Information-theoretic aspects</strong>: Relationship with black hole information problem and quantum entanglement.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>10.4 Future Development Directions</h3>
        <p>The following research topics can be considered for developing this theory:</p>
        <p><strong>Mathematical development:</strong> Rigorous mathematical formulation of phase deviation dynamics using irrational approximation theory and dynamical systems theory. Theoretical prediction of mass spectra using Diophantine approximation and continued fraction expansions.</p>
        <p><strong>Computational physics approach:</strong> Analysis of phase dynamics through large-scale numerical simulations. Prediction of particle mass patterns and optimization of theoretical parameters using machine learning.</p>
        <p><strong>Collaboration with experimental physics:</strong> High-precision verification of theoretical predictions through improved precision measurement techniques. Direct observation of phase structures through new types of interference experiments and gravitational wave detectors.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; border: none; padding: 0;">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In this research, starting from the basic principle that "all waves seek to close," we constructed a new theoretical framework that explains mass, gravity, speed of light, and spatial structure in a unified manner. We reinterpreted the kinetic term <span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">ℏ<span class="superscript">2</span></span><span class="denominator">2m</span></span> in the Schrödinger equation as phase correction energy and confirmed consistency with pure leptonic decay data.</p>
            
            <p>The core of the theory is the relationship θ ∝ <span class="sqrt">m</span> for irrational phase deviations, which simultaneously explains the origin of mass and the essence of gravity. The speed of light and Planck length are naturally derived as minimum units of phase closure and match observed values exactly.</p>
            
            <p>Future challenges include mathematical rigorization of the theory and application to a broader range of physical phenomena. Particularly, further research is needed on consistency with strong interactions and cosmology, and relationships with quantum information theory. However, the perspective of "unification of physics through phase structures" presented by this theory has the potential to open new horizons in 21st-century physics.</p>
